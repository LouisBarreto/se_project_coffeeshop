-Project Name: Practicum Coffee Shop

-Project Description: The Practicum Coffe shop project allows the user to Book a table, learn how to make a great coffee and browse a simple option menu with ease. The flex blox (previously learned) was used in order to space and place elements in their desired areas. The menu in particular really showed me how useful the flex box can really be.

-Improvements: I would really like to see a "find a store near me" function or simplet input (this may be too much for this part of the course). Another idea would in the menu where you can hover over the (in this case) Espresso's and Baked Good to see and actual picture of the item.
